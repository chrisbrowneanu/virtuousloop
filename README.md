# VirtuousLoop

The VirtuousLoop collection of scripts takes input from a Moodle database activity, and turns it into a PDF feedback report. These can then be shared with students.

Currently, the main features include:

* Feedback, such as a tutor marking assignments or in a peer review process
* Team Member Contributions, such as in a group assignment
* Course/Peer Feedback, such as during semester for course improvement or feedback on a peer's work
* Many Eyes Feedback, to collate the views of many perspectives
* Analysis on Marker Feedback, to aid with moderation
* Analysis on Student Feedback, to provide feedback on peer review

Alongside these, it can:

* Create a csv file to upload feedback to Moodle gradebook
* Create a json file to upload to a Moodle database activity
